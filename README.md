# Multilevel-Queue-MLQ-scheduling-algorithm-
### Problem Statement 
****
The project for CSC227: Operating Systems at King Saud University involves implementing a Multilevel Queue (MLQ) scheduling algorithm, which incorporates two queues (Q1 and Q2) with distinct priorities; Q1 has a higher priority than Q2. It requires developing a program that schedules processes based on their priority, using Round-Robin (RR) scheduling for Q1 with a time quantum of 3 ms, and non-preemptive Shortest-Job-First (SJF) scheduling for Q2.

The project stipulates the creation of two classes: one to represent the Process Control Block (PCB) and another as a driver class containing the main method. It will involve inputting process information (priority, arrival time, CPU burst time) and scheduling these processes according to the MLQ scheduling algorithm. The program should output detailed information about each process, including process ID, priority, arrival time, CPU burst, start and termination time, turnaround time, waiting time, and response time. Additionally, it should report average turnaround time, waiting time, and response time for all processes.

The implementation requires a menu-driven interface that allows users to enter process information, report on process scheduling, and exit the program. The final deliverables include the program code in Java, a comprehensive README file detailing the project's implementation, and screenshots demonstrating various scheduling scenarios and the output report.

This project aims to practically understand preemptive priority scheduling within a multilevel queue setup, focusing on algorithm implementation, process scheduling, and performance metric reporting.
